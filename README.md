## Introduction

This is a basic backend setup using Node.js and Express. The project includes configurations for environment variables, a basic server setup, and scripts for running and managing the server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine (>= v12.0.0)
- npm or yarn installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com-personal:username/CodeWithMe-BE.git
    cd CodeWithMe-BE
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Example:

    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=yourpassword
    DB_NAME=mydatabase
    ```

## Running the Server

To start the server in development mode, use the following command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file. By default, it will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
